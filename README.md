# NZ COVID Tracer - Surprise Generator

This project exists to allow users to use the little known "Easter Egg" feature from the NZ COVID Tracer app. It is not created by or affiliated with the Ministy of Health or the New Zealand Government.

I found this feature by reading the publically available source code. The source code, as well as the version that first added this feature, can be found here: https://github.com/minhealthnz/nzcovidtracer-app/commit/a00dd660c71750fc11a1109172c2a27448e31623
